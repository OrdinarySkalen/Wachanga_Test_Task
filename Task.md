### About task
This task can be done in an easy manner. But this is not what we want. We want you to shine use all the tech tricks, and all webdev magic that you can think of. Don’t be afraid to overengineer: Impress us!

### Imagine a universe with:
- an infinite amount of balls, each of them with a number (from 1 to 999) on it (so we have an infinite amount of balls #1, an infinite amount of balls #2 etc.)
- 30 baskets, each with a space for 10 balls
- our dear user has his own, special basket with space for 100 balls

### Now, what happens is:
- we fill each basket with a random amount (no higher than the basket’s capacity, higher than zero) of unique balls (so there is no basket with two balls #8, but ball #8 can be in many baskets)
- the user also fills his basket with a random amount of unique balls (same rules apply)

### What we want you to do:
Create an app that will:
- recreate the above scenario
- find baskets, that have only balls owned by the user
- find baskets, that have exactly one ball owned by the user

This task is your best opportunity to showcase your skills and impress us, so proceed wisely.

### Some guidelines:
- Business logic should reside in PHP components. What other tools you use is up to you.
- Make sure we will be able to decipher what you meant, writing readable code and being able to communicate your idea clearly is a crucial skill.
- Don't ask unnecessary questions, figure out the details on your own, be creative and smart about it if necessary (ain't it always? ;) ).
- Show us your skills and impress us.

### Simple example, to clarify everything:
Basket #1: 36, 78, 134

Basket #2: 1, 3, 135, 564, 693, 712, 831

Basket #3: 11, 290, 456

Basket #4: 78, 235, 987

Basket #5: 5, 90, 233, 455, 677, 899, 942, 987

User’s basket: 1, 3, 9, 36, 78, 134, 256, 290, 321, 332, 415, 550

- Answer to B: #1
- Answer to C: #4 and #3
